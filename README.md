This is the first attempt to post something on github, so do not judge strictly,  
Here is a program for classifying radar signals based on a convolutional neural network.  
The network was trained on the database downloaded from the site https://data.nist.gov/od/id/mds2-2116 . 
A feature of this project is the need to download the entire dataset to a hard disk and perform training on your personal computer.
