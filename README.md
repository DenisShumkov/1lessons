My first repository on githab
This is the first attempt to post something on the github, so do not judge strictly, the posted project has a program for classifying radar signals based on a convolutional neural network. The network was trained on the database downloaded from the site https://data.nist.gov/od/id/mds2-2116 . A feature of this project is the need to download the entire dataset to the hard disk.
